    fird "Let's have a look at the codes shall we?"
    fird "So this is how you make the turtle in Python"
    fird "You can use this for all kinds of graphics, these are just SOME of the basics"
    fird "The first part of the code is defining the Turtle object"
    fird "If you use another compiler, you need another line of code, but we will get into that in the Python Editor section"
    fird "tom = Turtle() is defining the name of the turtle, you can use any name, BUT NOT KEYWORDS!"
    fird "You can define the shape and colour of the turtle as well. Colour is spelled color as it follows the american syntax"
    fird "There are specific shapes and colours, where if you don't follow them, the turtle will just be a default arrow shape and black colour respectively"
    fird "You can set the turtle shapes, I heard, but that is for you to experiment"
    fird "Turtle has 4 directions, forward, backward, left and right. Notice the turtle drawing"
    fird "Where the turtle moves depend on its CURRENT position"
    fird "Also, the trainer will usually say MOVE for FORWARD and BACKWARD, and TURN for LEFT and RIGHT"
    fird "In the parantheses, the brackets that is, a number is written, right? That number for forward and backward is the pixel to move"
    fird "While for the left and right, it is the angles. You will learn about them soon enough"
    fird "Also notice those with the quotations, that are the  ' ', those are what we call strings"
    fird "Strings are what we use for text, don't use it for integers(numbers)!"
    fird "There is a code not included in the picture that is the penup() and pendown() feature. This is to make spaces between drawings"
    fird "There is also a code called goto, which is used for the coordinates"
    fird "There is another code there for the circle. In the parantheses, remember we use this name for brackets, is the radius of the circle"
    fird "Radius is half of the circle, that means the turtle drew from the halfway point"
    fird "Saves you the trouble of drawing a circle eh hahahaha"
    fird "Finally, there is also begin_fill() and end_fill() which are used to fill in the shape drawn between them. In this case, it fills in the circle"
    fird "Here are also some tips, a straight line has an angle of 180 degrees"
    fird "To get the exterior angle, you can use 180-interior angle"
    fird "Exterior angle is the angle outside the shape while interior angle is the angle inside the shape"
    fird "As you can see, you can draw a lot of things using the Python Turtle Graphics. Go ahead and use your creativity"

    fird "Let's have a look at the codes shall we?"
    fird "So this is how you make loops in Python"
    fird "For now I will be explaining about loops using Turtle Graphics. I will explain using mathematics concepts in future steps as there is much to break down"
    fird "Let's make the speed 0 first. 0 is the fastest speed, like SONICCCCCC"
    fird "A loop is something we can make so that we don't have to write the same codes again."
    fird "To make a loop, we need to use the syntax where we use for count in (1,2,3,4) (It is square brackets actually. I can't put the closing square bracket due to the limitation of this software)"
    fird "That method is where we use a list, but in case we want to make 100 iterations(repetitions), you can use for x in range(100)"
    fird "Note that count, x, and all those after the keyword for is just a name, it can be anyname AS LONG AS IT IS NOT A KEYWORD"
    fird "I advise you to use different loop names for each loop to easily differentiate them and make it a good programming practice"
    fird "Notice the space after the for line? That is what we call indentation(it consists of 4 spaces per indentation) and it is important"
    fird "Indented codes under the loop are what will be repeated"
    fird "If you want to fill in the shape using a loop, please put the begin and end fill outside that loop, so that it will fill in the shape, not the line"
    fird "There are also nested loops, meaning loop in loop, where the first loop will be executed first, then the program will wait for the second and so on loops to be executed"
    fird "before going on with the rest of the codes. There can be more than two loops in a nested loop"
    fird "Also notice that you can calculate the angle using 360 / the number of sides. This is because 360 is the total exterior angle"

    fird "So this is how you make variables in Python"
    fird "Variables are important as without them, you will have to write much longer codes"
    fird "Variables can also be manipulated, where you can use mathematical operations to manipulate them, hence making your program more dynamic and functional"
    fird "You can use any name for your variables as long as it fits the rules(no keywords, cannot start with numbers)"
    fird "The value is then assigned to the variable to be used for the future. Simple, right?"
    fird "You can also use input, which is where you ask the user for their value instead of defining it itself, making there be many answers to a single equation"
    fird "You will know that you have to use input if you see the keywords READ, USER, INPUT, KEYBOARD"
    fird "To use input, the syntax is datatype(input('message')) where the message is optional"
    fird "Some of commonly used datatypes are int (integer which is whole number), float(decimal) and string(text)"
    fird "When input is used, a box will appear. Input the value you desire and match the datatype of the input"
    fird "Print is used to print the output, but it only shows the output for the programmer, it is not really stored in the system"
    fird "How to store it in the system? Simple! Use return instead! I will explain more on that in the functions' section"

    fird "That is how functions work, you only need to call the function when you need them, or else they won't be executed"
    fird "The syntax is def functionName(paramaters which are optional):"
    fird "Like loops, you need the indentation for functions to work"
    fird "The function name can be any name but needs to follow the rules like no keywords, cannot start with number etc"
    fird "You can also use parameters which act like variables when calling the function"
    fird "Note that parameters follow the order from left to right and separated by the commas"
    fird "You need to call the function to execute it"
    fird "I really advise you to make all the functions first then call it to make it look more orderly"
    fird "You will also learn how to use return"
    fird "See how return doesn't show the output unless you put it in print?"
    fird "That is because print is for the developer to see the process, but only see, not send the data to be processed"
    fird "return is used to send the data back to the program, where it will be processed to be used in the system"

    fird "Index are seperated by , and starts from 0"
    fird "Example for the first list(lists use the square bracket), red is index 0, blue is index 1 and so on"
    fird "There are two basic ways to use the lists"
    fird "The first method is to make a loop with the range, then call the list by using the syntax listName(loopname) where the () is actually square brackets"
    fird "I can't put a complete square bracket here due to the limitations of this software"
    fird "The second is to use the listName itself as the range, that way, you just need to put the loopName when calling the list"
    fird "This is because you are directly using the list instead of before where you are using range and need to manually call the list"
    fird "The bottom part, notice how a variable is defined, but when printed, the variable changed value"
    fird "This is because the variable is added by the element of the next index until the list is completed"
    fird "0 is assigned as it will not effect the addition of the code"

    arif "User interface consists of the main interface in an app like textboxes and buttons"
    arif "Layout consists on how you want to organise your interface, such as putting four buttons in a single row"
    arif "Media consists of all those media components such as camera, sound for your app, a player to play songs maybe? Sound recorders and even text to speech are there!"
    arif "Drawing and animation is more to animating sprites"
    arif "Sensors contain components that app will use your phone to detect. Example, accelerometer sensor will execute a function if your phone is moving"
    arif "Storage is mostly for database, storing your item's information. Really handy for games!"
    arif "There are more I did not explain, go ahead and explore them!"

    arif "Number 3, halfway there dude, kinda!"

    arif "Sometimes the display is not 100% accurate, but it is almost there"
    arif "Since some components are hidden like the sensors, they are by default unticked when you put them in"
    arif "The hidden components will not disturb the appearance of your application"
    arif "You can also change the responsiveness of the viewer to that of a tab and so, by default it is this phone size"

    arif "Number 4 is the components you input earlier from the pallette, and it have a lot in common with number 7"
    arif "You can select the component you insert, and change the properties as well"
    arif "Different components have different properties, but components of the same type can be given different properties"

    arif "The components you use have their own specific blocks too, see how the example made a block where if you press the button, your app will talk and greet you!"
